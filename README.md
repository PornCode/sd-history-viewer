# Application Installation and Launch Guide
[üá∑üá∫ –ß–∏—Ç–∞—Ç—å –Ω–∞ —Ä—É—Å—Å–∫–æ–º](README_ru.md)
## Description

This application is an image viewer that displays generation metadata. Often, when generating images using Stable Diffusion, you may forget which parameters you used. This application conveniently lets you view images from a specified directory (typically `/Users/PornCode/stable-diffusion-webui-forge/outputs`) and its subfolders. When selecting an image, it displays the prompt, negative prompt, and all associated metadata.

You can add multiple directories (e.g., for Stable Diffusion and ComfyUI) and easily switch between them directly from the application's interface. The app also supports image search using metadata indexing, which automatically initiates upon adding a directory. The index updates automatically upon subsequent launches if new files have been added.
